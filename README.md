# ToDo

## Description:
This project was an assignment for the MIT XPRO course. We were given some files and code to work with and were instructed to  create a styled ToDo list application in React. I choose to add styling to the page by adding a hover over the todo list items so that it will highlight what you have completed and want to delete. I also added some quotes to help encourage completiion of tasks. I styled the Heading and changed the colors as well. I really enjoyed working on this project.
